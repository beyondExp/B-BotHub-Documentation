### Basic Information

The Basic information is not editable anymore after the expert is created. If you want to change the basic information you have to create a new expert.
This lies on our philosophy that the basic information is the core of the expert and should not be changed after the expert is created.
The basic information includes the name, the profession, the description, these will be used as a wake word for the model to understand how it should act.
if we would change these the model would not understand how it should act anymore.
