## Creating and Adding the API Key

To use the B-Bot API, you need to generate an API key from your profile. Follow these steps to create and add the API key:

### Step 1: Log in to Your Profile

1. Visit the B-Bot hub at https://hub.b-bot-space
2. Log in using your credentials.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Profile Section

1. Once logged in, go to the **Profile** section.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page where the API Key management section is located.

### Step 3: Generate an API Key

1. In the API Key management section, find the option to generate a new API key.
2. Click the **Generate API Key** button.
3. A new API key will be generated and displayed. Make sure to copy and save this key in a secure location. You will not be able to view it again once you navigate away from the page. (In Betatests they will be viewable all the time)

### Step 4: Use the API Key

1. When making requests to the B-Bot API, include the API key in the request headers.
2. The header should be formatted as follows:

   ```makefile
   bbot-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

   ```

### Example of Adding the API Key to a Request

Here is an example of how to include the API key in a cURL request to the `api/v1/invoke_llm` endpoint:

```bash
bashCode kopieren
curl -X POST https://your-api-url.com/api/v1/invoke_llm \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "bbot-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
-d '{
    "expert_id": 37,
    "model_id": 6,
    "input_data": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ],
    "temperature": 1,
    "msx_tokens": 250
}'

```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the API key you generated from your profile.

<Note>Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.</Note>
<Note>
  If you believe your API key has been compromised, you can regenerate a new key
  from the Profile section by following the same steps.
