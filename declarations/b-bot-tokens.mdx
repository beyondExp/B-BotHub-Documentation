# Why B-Bot Tokens?

## The Purpose of B-Bot Tokens

B-Bot Tokens were created to simplify and standardize the pricing of AI models and services across different platforms. Rather than dealing with varying prices per 1,000 tokens for different models, B-Bot Tokens allow users to easily compare the cost of using any model, regardless of which platform or version they are using. This makes it easier to budget for your AI-related expenses and track usage across multiple models.

### Key Benefits:

- **Simplicity**: Every model's cost is represented in a consistent B-Bot Token format, so you don’t have to worry about complex pricing variations between platforms.
- **Transparency**: With B-Bot Tokens, the cost per token is fixed at $0.0000001. This makes it easier to calculate and understand exactly how much you are spending on any given model or service.
- **Flexibility**: B-Bot Tokens work across all the models integrated with our platform, including OpenAI and Azure models, providing a unified experience regardless of the technology you use.

## Why Use a Multiplier for Models?

Each AI model has different computational costs associated with processing input and generating output. To account for this, we've introduced a multiplier system where each model’s usage is converted into B-Bot Tokens. This way, you can see the relative costs of different models in a straightforward and consistent manner.

For example, a more advanced model like GPT-4 will have a higher multiplier because it requires more computational resources, while a lighter model like GPT-3.5 will have a lower multiplier.

This multiplier-based system allows you to compare different models in terms of their cost-effectiveness for your specific needs.

## Cost of a B-Bot Token

Each B-Bot Token costs $0.0000001
making it the most affordable unit in the pricing structure. This extremely low cost per token allows for granular control and pricing transparency when using various AI models.
